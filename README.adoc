= Collection of Wordle Variants


[CAUTION]

https://rwmpelstilzchen.gitlab.io/wordles/[WORDLES] - This list was made before coming across WORDLES. Now that it exists, this repo has no purpose. Please refer to it. *There are a few variants that it misses are covered here.*


[IMPORTANT]

Credits go to https://github.com/maxspero[maxspero], the original creator of the https://gist.github.com/maxspero/0a2f536b9561d829caf6bd994a34193d[wordle_variants.md] list. This is a "fork" of his work with the aim of keeping a more updated list. We are grateful for his effort on attempting to collect all wordle variants!

This list borrows a LOT from the original wordle_variants.md
